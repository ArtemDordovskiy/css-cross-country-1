#### Nested Selectors
By default nested elements automatically inherit parent styles, but sometimes we expect a different behavior from nested elements. On those cases is very important to know the **specificity rule** (the priority of selectors). Think os specificity as four digits number, where the lowest values are in the amount of elements selectors (a, p, img, div, etc); and the highest values are in the inline selectors. ex.:

######0,0,0,1
```css
    p { color: #fff; }
```

######0,0,1,0
```css
    .intro { color: #98c7d4; }
```

######0,1,0,0
```css
    #header { color: #444245; }
```

######1,0,0,0
```html
    <h1 style="color: #000;">Mogul</h1>
```

##### Challenge
Use a nested selector to make paragraphs only within asides `italic`.
