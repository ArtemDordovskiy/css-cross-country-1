#### Box Model Overflow
When adapting a design to its content is important to have in mind that a content could request to be overflow. The css has the `overflow` property that could be set as `visible` / `auto` / `hidden` / `scroll`. the overflow is by default applied for both axis, but is possible to restrict it to each axi using `overflow-x` or `overflow-y`.

##### Challenge
Add an appropriate content height to give the `<figure>` a height of `120px`, hide any `overflow` on the `x-axis`, and add a `scroll bar` on the `y-axis` if necessary. Hint: Use `overflow-x` and `overflow-y` to target the different axes.
