#### Positioning
To setup layout positioning, the css, brings the `position` property. It could be set as one of the follow values: `static`, `relative`, `absolute` and `fixed`. Using a value other than `static` causes an object to become a **positioned** element. After became a **positioned element**, the element could use the `top`, `left`, `bottom`, and `right` properties for placement.

#### Relative Positioning
After set as relative, the renders occours in the normal flow, then shifted via positioning properties.

##### Challenge
Anchors with a `.button` class are floated to the right of our `<h3>`, but we'd like them to be centered vertically. Use `relative positioning` to move the button down `3px`.
