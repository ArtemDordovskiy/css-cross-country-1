### Level 1

#### External Stylesheets
1. Refactor the <head> tag so that all CSS is instead found on an external stylesheet;

#### ID Selector
1. Select the slogan only by its ID attribute, then center the text and make it italic;

#### Compound Selector
1. Add a declaration that selects the <section> via both class attributes, removing the border when both are present;

#### Style Specificity
1. Remove the non-external styles found on the HTML page so that !important is no longer needed to set the <header> background in style.css.
