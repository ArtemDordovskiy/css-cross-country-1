Code School - Learn the fundamentals &amp; foundational elements of CSS with CSS Cross-Country. Review all the web-styling necessities for front-end efficiency. 

### Level 1

#### External Stylesheets
Refactor the <head> tag so that all CSS is instead found on an external stylesheet;

#### ID Selector
Select the slogan only by its ID attribute, then center the text and make it italic;

#### Compound Selector
Add a declaration that selects the <section> via both class attributes, removing the border when both are present;

#### Style Specificity
Remove the non-external styles found on the HTML page so that !important is no longer needed to set the <header> background in style.css.

#### Floats
Float the <aside> to the right and add 10px of margin to its left and bottom sides.
